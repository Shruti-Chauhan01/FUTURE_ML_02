# FUTURE_ML_02: Customer Churn Prediction System

## Project Overview
This project builds a Customer Churn Prediction System using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers likely to stop using a service based on telecom customer data. Predicting churn helps businesses improve retention and reduce revenue loss.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle, containing customer demographics, account information, and service usage details.

## Key Steps
- Data exploration and cleaning
- Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables
- Model training and evaluation using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Visualization of key churn drivers and business insights with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Final report generation with model performance and actionable insights

## Technologies & Tools
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for development

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to reproduce analysis and model results
